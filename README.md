# Swag Labs Automation

![Build](https://github.com/alixhanbasha/ECommerce-SwagLabs-Java-Automation/actions/workflows/maven.yml/badge.svg)

This is an example automation project that demonstrates the power and flexibility of Java + SerenityBDD with the Screen Play Pattern.

On top of that, it's a project used to showcase skills and abilities I have gained throughout my career ( shameless plug :D ).

    * Mostly API with Gatling

  * UI/API testing with Postman
  * Writing/maintaining test cases

I chose Notion for test management because of its free plan and web-hosting. Ideally I would choose Jira/Xray but that's not free.
